Look, fair warning. If you're feeling a little hungry right now, you might want to pause this video and grab a snack before continuing because I'm going to explain the difference between machine learning and deep learning by talking about pizza. Delicious, tasty pizza. Now before we get to that, let's address the fundamental question here. What is the difference between these two terms? Well put simply, deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Actually, the hierarchy goes like this. At the top we have AI or artificial intelligence. Now a subfield of AI is ML or machine learning. Beneath that, then we have NN or neural networks. And they make up the backbone of deep learning algorithms, DL. And here on the IBM technology channel, we have a whole bunch of videos on these topics. You might want to consider subscribing. Now machine learning algorithms leverage structured labeled data to make predictions. So let's build one and model to determine whether we should order pizza for dinner. There are three main factors that influence that decision. So let's map those out as inputs. The first of those inputs will call X1. And X1 asks, will it save time by ordering out? We can say yes with a 1 or no with a 0. Yes it will, so X, that equals 1. Now X2, that input says, will I lose weight by ordering pizza? That's a zero, I'm ordering all the toppings. And X3, will it save me money? Actually I have a coupon for a free pizza today, so that's a one. Now look, these binary responses, ones and zeros, I'm using them for simplicity, but neurons in a network can represent values from, well, everything to everything, negative infinity to positive infinity. With our inputs defined, we can assign weights to determine importance. Larger weights make a single inputs contribution to the output, more significant compared to other inputs. Now my threshold here is five. So let's wait each one of these. W1, well, I'm going to give this a full five, because I value my time. W2, this was the, will I lose weight one? I'm going to rate this a three, because I have some interest in keeping in shape. And for W3, I'm going to give this a two, because let either way, this isn't going to break the bank to order dinner. Now we plug these weights into our model, and using an activation function, we can calculate the output, which in this case is the decision to order pizza or not. So to calculate that, we're going to calculate the y hat, and we're going to use these weights and these inputs. So here we've got one times five, we've got zero times three, and we've got one times two. And we need to consider as well our threshold, which was five. So that gives us, if we just add these up one times five, that's five, plus zero times three, that's zero, plus one times two, that's two, minus five. Well, that gives us a total of, positive two. And because the output is a positive number, this correlates to pizza night. Okay, so that's machine learning, but what differentiates deep learning? Well, the answer to that is more than three. As in, neural network is considered a deep neural network. If it consists of more than three layers, and that includes the input and the output layer. So we've got our input and output. We have multiple layers in the middle, and this would be considered a deep learning network. Classical machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts, well, they determine a hierarchy of features to understand the differences between data inputs. So if I showed you a series of images of different types of fast food, like pizza, burger, and taco, you could label these in a data set for processing by the neural network. Human expert here has determined the characteristics, which distinguish each picture as the specific fast food type. So for example, it might be the bread of each food type, might be a distinguishing feature across each picture. Now this is known as supervised learning, because the process incorporates human intervention or human supervision. Deep machine learning doesn't necessarily require a labeled dataset. It can ingest unstructured data in its raw form, like text and images, and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish pizza, burger, and taco from one another. By observing patterns in the data, a deep learning model can cluster inputs appropriately. These algorithms discover hidden patterns of data, groupings without the need for human intervention, and they're known as unsupervised learning. Most deep neural networks are feed forward. That means that they go in one direction from the input to the output. However, you can also train your model through something called back propagation. That is, it moves in the opposite direction from output to input. Back propagation allows us to calculate and attribute the error associated with each neuron and allows us to adjust and fit the algorithm appropriately. So when we talk about machine learning and deep learning, we're essentially talking about the same field of study. Neural networks, they're the foundation of both types of learning, and both are considered subfields of AI. The main distinction between the two are that number of layers in a neural network, more than three, and whether or not human intervention is required to label data. Pizza, burgers, tacos. Yeah, that's enough for today. It's time for lunch. Oh, oh, I'm for a co. If you did enjoy this video, here are some others you might also like.
