**Structured Study Notes: Neural Networks in Under Five Minutes**

I. Introduction to Neural Networks

* Composed of node layers (input, hidden, output)
* Reflect behavior of human brain, allowing computer programs to recognize patterns and solve common problems in AI and deep learning
* Artificial neural network (ANN) vs. unartificial neural network in the human brain

II. Each Node is a Linear Regression Model

* Data passed from one layer to next in feed-forward network
* Each node composed of input data, weights, bias/threshold, and output
* Input data influenced by weights and bias/threshold, resulting in output

III. Example Node: Going Surfing

* Decision to go surfing predicted using linear regression model
* Three factors influencing decision (wave's good, line up empty, shark free)
* Weights assigned to each factor based on importance (0-5 scale)
* Output of node determined by weighted sum of input data and threshold

IV. Training Data is Critical

* Neural networks rely on training data to learn and improve accuracy over time
* Supervised learning on labeled data sets used to train algorithm
* Cost function evaluated to determine model's accuracy
* Gradient descent adjusts weights and biases to minimize cost function and ensure correctness for any given observation

V. Types of Neural Networks Beyond Feed Forward

* Recurrent neural networks (RNNs): loop connections allow processing sequential data
* Convolutional neural networks (CNNs): specialized for image recognition using convolutional and pooling layers
* Autoencoders: learn to compress and reconstruct input data, useful for dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection.
